# School_District_Analysis
PyCitySchoools with Pandas

## Overview of the school district analysis
An existing school district analysis had completed and handed into Maria, a chief data scientist for a city school disctrict. However, Maria asked us to refactor the existing analysis to provide an updated one by replacing the math and reading scroes from 9th grade in Thomas High School with NaN while keeping the rest of the data intact. The update school district analysis shall reflect different average and passing percetage while excluding Thomas High School's 9th grade score. 

## Result
* How is district Summary affected: 
  * The number of schools, students and budgets are the same.
  * Average Math score updates from 79 to 78.9 
  * Average Reading score stays the same as 81.9
  * % Passing Math updates from 75 to 74.8
  * % Passing Reading updates from 85.8 to 85.7
  * % Overall Passing from 65.2 to 64.9
